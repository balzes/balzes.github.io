The first post of this blog.

I think about this site as a notes holder rather than a blog so I plan to reformat it and center it around topics/projects. 

Meanwhile, the blog section will serve as a progress tracker.

The site is based on [Jekyll]("https://jekyllrb.com/") and a result of an idea to give a try for [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) as a note-taking replacement for MacNotes/OneNote/Evernote as it Git friendly so easily sharable, trackable and "backupable". 
During this google research, the old idea of studying some web-technologies come to life.
