![Adding favicon](/assets/images/add_favicon.png)  

The simple solution is to just create `favicon.ico` and place it in the root folder.
However, the favicon may be also be used as an app icon on Android/iOS or appear on MacBook TouchBar and for all these use cases to work correctly there are  some sites to convert your image or text into icons of all required formats and even generate HTML lines to add:  
One of the incredible sites for this, [www.favicon.io](https://www.favicon.io/):  

```HTML
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">
  <link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
```

`site.webmanifest` is a text file in JSON format that enables saving your site as an application and defines icon to be used (see [Progressive Web Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)).  
In iOS to see it on your Home Screen: __Safari->your site->Share icon->Add to Home Screen__  
(This option is not available in Chrome on iOS).

Flow in Jekyll:

1. Locate your current style default head.html (im my case for minima style):  
`bundle info --path minima`
1. Copy `head.html` to your site's `_includes` folder to override the default.
1. Add generated HTML lines somewhere between `<head> </head>` tags.
1. copy all icons and `site.webmanifest` to your root folder.
1. Test in browser using:
`bundle exec jekyll serve --draft`
1. Generate final version for upload to your hosting:  
~~`bundle exec jekyll build`~~  
`JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build`
