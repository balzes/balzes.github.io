One evening, I was googling about markdown formatting of confluence page and found an answer on some blog that pointed out to [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) - a tool that creates a full website from one configuration file `_confg.yml` and a markdown file per page. 
After spending a few more hours and $10 on a domain+hosting, I created my first web page on the internet and became +1 to the blogging community. 

Initially, the main purpose of the blog was to study and play with web technologies (I'm from the HW sphere), but I kept it online to share some debugging notes from my hobby projects that might be helpful to someone and may be to get some useful comments or find co-thinkers for the future ideas.
